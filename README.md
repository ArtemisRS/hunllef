for a perfect fight.

Can set the following variables from the CLI
- num of trials to sim
- num of fish to consume
- tier of CG armour
- stat level (range/mage) - this has not been tested
- prayer (TBD)

Will output number of successful trials (defined as Hunllef dead and player
alive) and number of failures (player dead).
